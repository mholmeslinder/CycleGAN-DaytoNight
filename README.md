# CycleGAN Day <-> Night

This repo is an adaptation of the work in [this blog post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-cyclegan-models-from-scratch-with-keras/), which is then applied to the field of image dataset augmentation. In autonomous drive, training data can be limited and expensive, so having the ability to augment that data - in this case, transforming daytime images into night and vice versa - is very valuable.

## Environment/Requirements
This repo contains an environment.yml file that you can use with your package manager of choice to reproduce the environment/download the necessary packages.

## How to use this repo
